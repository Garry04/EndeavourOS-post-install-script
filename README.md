## NOTE
**This script is made for EndeavourOS and hasn't been tested on other Arch-based distributions. Currently, it doesn't have support for Nvidia drivers, but I'm working on fixing this. Everything else should install just fine.**

## FEATURES
- Various performance and latency improvements (Optional)
- Sets dns servers to only use secure ones to prevent malicious dns servers
- Customization options
- Installs necessary GPU drivers (Except for Nvidia at the moment)
- Numlock enabled by default
